                            XML, or Extensible Markup Language, is a markup language that you can use to create your own tags. It was created by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to overcome the limitations of HTML, the Hypertext Markup Language that is the basis for all Web pages.
                            Like HTML, XML is based on SGML -- Standard Generalized Markup Language. This is and ISO standard (ISO8879) defined in 1986 in the field of electronic document management. However, it complexity intimidated many people that
                            might haveus ed it. XML was designed with the Web in mind. Now that you've seen how developers can use XML to create documents with self-describing data, let's look at how people are using those documents to improve the Web.
                            Here are a few key areas:

                                XML enables smart searches. Although search engines have improved steadily over the years, it's still quite common to get erroneous results from a search. If you're searching HTML pages for someone named "Chip," you might also find pages on chocolate
                                chips, computer chips, wood chips, and lots of other useless matches. Searching XML documents for
