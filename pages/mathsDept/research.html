                                XML enables smart searches. Although search engines have improved steadily over
                                the years, it's still quite common to get erroneous results from a search. If you're
                                searching HTML pages for someone named "Chip," you might also find pages on
                                chocolate chips, computer chips, wood chips, and lots of other useless matches.

                                ap up this discussion of the sample HTML document, consider the task of extracting the
                                postal code from this address. Here's an (intentionally brittle) algorithm for finding
                                the postal
                                code in HTML markup:
                                If you find a paragraph with two tags, the postal code is the second word after the
                                first
                                comma in the second break tag.
                                Although this algorithm works with this example, there are any number of perfectly valid
                                addresses worldwide for which this simply wouldn't work. Even if you could write an
                                algorithm that found the postal code for any address written in HTML, there are any
                                number
